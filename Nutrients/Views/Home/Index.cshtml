                    Although the perfect diet does not exist because of the variations of body types and levels of activity for each individual,
                    the following tables contain recommended nutrient intake values for different nutrients for the average person. The tables are
                    broken down into child, adult, lower income and higher income and how these demographics consume different nutrients at
                    home, at restaurants, from fast food and at school, and compares them to the recommended amount of the specific nutrient.
                    The nutrients being looked at are sodium, saturated fat, total fat and cholesterol. One of the highlights of this data is showing
                    the health benefits of eating at home as opposed to eating out or at school where a consumer can far exceed their daily intake
                    of certain nutrients.
